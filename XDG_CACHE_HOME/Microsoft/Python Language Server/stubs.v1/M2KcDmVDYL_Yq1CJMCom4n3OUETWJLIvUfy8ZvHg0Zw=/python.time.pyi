It may be an integer\nor a floating point number (to represent fractions of seconds).\nThe Epoch is system-defined; on Unix, it is generally January 1st, 1970.\nThe actual value can be retrieved by calling gmtime(0).\n\nThe other representation is a tuple of 9 integers giving local time.\nThe tuple items are:\n  year (four digits, e.g. 1998)\n  month (1-12)\n  day (1-31)\n  hours (0-23)\n  minutes (0-59)\n  seconds (0-59)\n  weekday (0-6, Monday is 0)\n  Julian day (day in the year, 1-366)\n  DST (Daylight Savings Time) flag (-1, 0 or 1)\nIf the DST flag is 0, the time is given in the regular time zone;\nif it is 1, the time is given in the DST time zone;\nif it is -1, mktime() should guess based on the date and time.\n\nVariables:\n\ntimezone -- difference in seconds between UTC and local standard time\naltzone -- difference in  seconds between UTC and local DST time\ndaylight -- whether local time should reflect DST\ntzname -- tuple of (standard time zone name, DST time zone name)\n\nFunctions:\n\ntime() -- return current time in seconds since the Epoch as a float\nclock() -- return CPU time since process start as a float\nsleep() -- delay for a number of seconds given as a float\ngmtime() -- convert seconds since Epoch to UTC tuple\nlocaltime() -- convert seconds since Epoch to local time tuple\nasctime() -- convert time tuple to string\nctime() -- convert time in seconds to string\nmktime() -- convert local time tuple to seconds since Epoch\nstrftime() -- convert time tuple to string according to format specification\nstrptime() -- parse string to time tuple according to format specification\ntzset() -- change the local timezone'
