Program folder - Description
-----------------------------
In the programs folder, each folder contains a program in C. Each folder must be structured like this:
 - arc_prim: Folder containing some files related to program primitive nodes
    - {function}.gfc: Program Graph flow control generated by Proteum
    - {function}.tes: This file contains the primitive nodes definition of this function
 - log: Folder containing results from Proteum run and initial analyzes
 - {program}.c: Program under testing
 - testset.txt: Adequate testset. Each input for the program is on a line
 - unit.txt: File containing the functions under testing in the program.
